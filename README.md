The script run_analyses.R  Merges the training and the test sets from this source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to create one data set. It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement given in the dataset. It uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and gives appropriate labels to the data set with descriptive variable names. Finally, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
